To interface with a rotary encoder and count the number of pulses from the A and B signals, you can follow these steps:

1. Connect the A and B channels of the rotary encoder to digital input pins of your microcontroller or any other suitable interface.

2. Set up interrupt routines or polling mechanisms to detect the rising or falling edges of the A and B signals.

3. Implement the logic to determine the direction of rotation based on the phase relationship between the A and B signals. You can use a state machine or lookup table to track the position and direction of the encoder.

4. Maintain a count variable that increments or decrements based on the direction of rotation detected.

Regarding the software practical low-pass filter (LPF), the cutoff frequency (fc) can be determined based on the maximum speed and the number of pulses per revolution of the encoder. Here's how you can calculate it:

1. Calculate the circumference of the wheel:
   Circumference = π * Diameter
                 = 3.14159 * 0.4 m
                 = 1.25664 m

2. Calculate the distance covered per pulse:
   Distance per pulse = Circumference / Pulses per revolution
                     = 1.25664 m / 540 pulses
                     ≈ 0.00233 m/pulse

3. Calculate the maximum frequency of pulses produced at the maximum speed:
   Maximum frequency = Maximum speed / Distance per pulse
                    = 0.5 m/s / 0.00233 m/pulse
                    ≈ 214.96 pulses/second

4. Choose a cutoff frequency (fc) that is higher than the maximum frequency of pulses. It is generally recommended to set the cutoff frequency at least twice the maximum frequency to ensure accurate counting. Therefore, in this case, a suitable cutoff frequency would be around 400 pulses/second (or Hz).

Remember that the actual implementation may require adjustments based on the specific characteristics of the encoder and the microcontroller or interface you are using.
